# SignOutSync

**SignOutSync** is a security-focused project that allows users to manage and monitor their logged-in accounts across multiple devices. With a simple interface, users can view all their active sessions and remotely log out from any device or account. This is especially useful if an account or device is compromised. Future enhancements will integrate AI to detect suspicious login behaviors and send alerts for security threats.

## Features

- View all logged-in accounts and devices.
- Remotely log out from specific devices or accounts.
- Automatic alerts for suspicious login activity (planned).
- AI-powered monitoring for failed login attempts and logins from unfamiliar locations (future update).

## Future Plans

- AI-based detection for multiple failed login attempts.
- Alerts for unfamiliar login locations.
- Integration with OAuth and popular apps for streamlined logout management.
